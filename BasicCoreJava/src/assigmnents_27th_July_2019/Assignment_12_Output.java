	 * DOUBTS
	 * 
	 * 1. Can we define any method any method
	 * anywhere and use it anywhere? In this case its defined later and used first
	 * if we see line-wise 
	 * 2. Why I am not able to add print statement in this method
	 * and print the output? is it because this method is outside the main method?
	 * 3. Explain the significance of main method ? What exactly it means ?
