Q1) What is log?
Ans. Capturing info/activities at the time of program execution.

Q2) Types of logs:
Ans.    //1. info
		//2. warn
		//3. debug
		//4. fatal
		
Q3) How to generate the logs? 
Ans. Use Apache log4j API.
Log4j is a fast, flexible and reliable logging framework (APIS) written in Java
In Log4j, we use log statements rather than SOPL statements in the code to know the 
status of a project while it is executing.

Log4j has three principal components : Loggers , Appenders , Layout.

Loggers : It is responsible for logging information.

Appenders : It is used to deliver LogEvents to their destination. 
It decides what will happen with log information. In simple words, 
it is used to write the logs in file. Following are few types of Appenders
ConsoleAppender logs to standard output
File appender prints logs to some file
Rolling file appender to a file with maximum size

Layouts: It is responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.

Q4) How it works?
Ans. It reads log 4j configuration from log4j.properties file from src/main/resources folder.


We can use the Logger class to get the 4 types of Info ;

Logger log = Logger.getLogger(ClassName.class);

 a. log.info("launching chrome broswer");
 b. log.warn("Hey this just a warning message");
 c. log.fatal("hey this is just fatal error message");
 d. log.debug("this is debug message");
